# Automating adding context to links in a PKMS

It would be nice for a program to automatically derive a reason why your future self should follow that link. Good application for machine learning. Given a body of text such as a zettel and links to other related body of texts, the program should come up with keywords or a summary as to why someone would follow that link.
