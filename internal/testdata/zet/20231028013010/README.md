# Zettel 2

This is the zettel body that has been updated.

The aim of the `zet` tool is to manage knowledge. This tool is built for the command line. This tool will not encapsulate the entire system; it will rely on existing technologies when possible. For instance, the responsibility for conversion from markdown to pdf will be put on external tools such as `pandoc`.
