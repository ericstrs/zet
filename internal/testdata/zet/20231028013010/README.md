# Context for conceptual linking

Including the reason *why* you are creating a link is good practice. It forces you to justify the link. It prevents you from getting too ahead of yourself and polluting the zettel. Reasoning will also cut down the time for your future self to figure out why you should follow the link.

When deciding on attaching context to a particular link between concepts, there are two scenarios to look at:

1. Including the link as a footnote.
1. Including the link in a "See more:" section.

When we are creating a footnote for a link, generally, the context has already been established by the sentence the footnote resides. Therefore, we need not add more context.

The "See more:" section usually is links that describe a more broad concept that might have a weaker relationship to the current text. In such case, you would benefit from including why someone would want to follow the link.
